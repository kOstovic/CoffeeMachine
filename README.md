## Running CoffeeMachineRestApi

Same is for CoffeeMachineRestApiV1 and CoffeeMachineRestApiV2
Run command in cmd/CoffeeMachineRestApi
```
go build -o coffeeMachine.exe main.go
```
and run coffeeMachine.exe

API is running in localhost:3000
(port will be customizable in future refactor)

Postman collection can be used for testing or just go to swagger endpoint in CoffeeMachineRestApiV2.

## Running CoffeeMachineConsole

Run command in cmd/CoffeeMachineConsoleV1 or cmd/CoffeeMachineConsoleV3
```
go build -o coffeeMachine.exe main.go
```
and run coffeeMachine.exe

APP is running in local a console, commands are shown in console (or from help command in v3)
and example jsons for commands can be taken from postman collection


## Docker

Currently, building Dockerfile from deployments/apiVersion/Dockerfile

Run BuildDocker.ps1 in api folder to automatically build docker image - if you previously set: Set-ExecutionPolicy unrestricted

Or just run BuildDocker.bat

After that you can run this docker image for example on some other port like this:
```
docker run -p 3002:3000 github.com/kostovic/coffeemachine:restapiv2.0
```
restapiv2.0 is running in production mode by default
